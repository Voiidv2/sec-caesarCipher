## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Voiidv2/sec-caesarCipher)

This project was started to have a better understanding of one of the most widely known encryption methods known as Caesar's cipher. There are two fields, and a counter in the middle where you select the key. Once you start entering text into the 'Plain Text' field, it will show the encrypted text in the 'Cipher Text' field.

### Built With

React was used in order to make it easy to build the interface thanks to React being component-based and during this time I was also learning React.
Bootstrap was used for the styling as it is easy to use and makes development of the front end very quick.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
